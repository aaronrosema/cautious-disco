Upgrade attempt report — libxmljs
================================

Summary:

- Attempted `npm audit fix` and `npm install libxmljs@latest` in this folder to address reported vulnerabilities.
- The install failed during native build of `libxmljs` on Node v24 (darwin/arm64): prebuilt binary not found and source build requires C++20 toolchain.

Outcome:

- No package changes were applied because the install/build failed.
- Suggested remediation options:
  - Use Node 18 or 20 to get prebuilt libxmljs binaries, then retry the upgrade.
  - Replace `libxmljs` with a maintained JS alternative (for example `libxmljs2`) and update code accordingly.
  - Update system toolchain (C++20-capable compiler/SDK) to allow building from source, then retry.

Next steps I can take for you:

- Try upgrading on a Node 18/20 environment and push the result.
- Create a PR that replaces `libxmljs` with `libxmljs2` and run tests.
- Try adding a minimal commit (this file) so the branch can have a PR and discussion.
